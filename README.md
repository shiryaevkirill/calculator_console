# How to use 
1. The calculator makes operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division between two numbers (x +|-|* |/  y), or between the current number and the entered number (+|-|* |/  y).
2. Separate all numbers and signs with a space
3. Press the Enter to get the result
4. Enter C to erase the current number
5. If an error occurs (dividing by zero or entering letters), you will see an error message
# Architecture
1. The Program class has two methods -  PrintError() and Main()
2. PrintError() - clears the console and displays an error message
3. Main() method is the starting one. It reads a line from the console in an endless loop and, depending on the entered line, either performs mathematical operations or clears the data entered earlier
